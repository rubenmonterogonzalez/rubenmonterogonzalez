- 👋 Hi, I’m @rubenmonterogonzalez, just a guy who discovered this world and he realized that the learning is infinite. That's why this world is so amazing.
- 👀 I’m interested in front-end/client-side specially, but I have fun figuring out new things.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the basics. HTML/CSS and JS. I started with Angular and C# though, but I had to back and start building the house by the floor.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on whatever you thing I am capable.
- 📫 How to reach me ... here: rubenmontero@rocketmail.com
