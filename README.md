# hello-world👋

I'm Ruben, just a guy who discovered this world 🌎 about the art of programming. Someone 🎓 gave me the opportunity to get into web development and I started developing landing pages for clients and ended up collaborating on SPA projects 💼 using Angular and most recently React.js and Vue.js. 

Since then, I have not stopped to get involved in different projects and finding new bugs. I am a visual person and design is everything, which is why I like to combine the art of design with the art of coding. Especially interested in the client / front end, but I have fun discovering new things. Always open to learn new stuff.
