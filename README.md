Hi, I'm Ruben, just a guy who discovered this world about the art of programming. 
Someone gave me the opportunity to get into web development and I started developing landing pages for clients and ended up collaborating on SPA projects using Angular and most recently React.js. 
Since then, I have not stopped to get involved in different projects and finding new bugs.
I am a visual person and design is everything, which is why I like to combine the art of design with the art of coding.
Especially interested in the client / front end, but I have fun discovering new things.
Always open to learn new stuff.
